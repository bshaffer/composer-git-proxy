# Git Subrepository Split

## Post-Receive Hook

The repository split is triggered on a git post-receive hook. When triggered,
the split should occur only when a new version in the parent repository has been
tagged. This is done by checking to see if the git reference is a tag:

```sh
if [[ "$refname" == refs/tags/* ]]; then
    # Do the split!
    PARENT_TAG=${refname:10}
    bash split.sh $PARENT_TAG $GITHUB_TOKEN
else
    echo "Split occurs only in a tag run"
fi
```

## Subtree Split

The command [git subtree split](http://git-memo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subtree.html)
is used to separate one repository into multiple repositories. The third party
library [splitsh](https://github.com/splitsh/lite) is useful for easily creating
a subtree split from a git project and pushing to a github repository.

```sh
$ git fetch --unshallow
$ split sub/directory "$USER/$REPO.git"
```

The command `git fetch --unshallow` ensures the entire commit history is used
for the split.

## Versioning

In the directory which serves the root of the subrepository, a `VERSION` file is
used to track the tagged version of the sub repository.

$ cat sub/directory/VERSION
0.1.0

When the subtree split occurs, the version file should be used to tag the
repository. If the tag specified in the VERSION file doesnâ€™t exist, it should be
created.

```sh
if curl -f https://api.github.com/repos/$USER/$REPO/releases/tags/v0.1.0 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" >> /dev/null; then
    curl https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc-php/releases \
        -d 'tag_name=v0.1.0' \
        -d 'name=Subrepository Split v0.1.0' \
        -d 'body=For release notes, please see [$USER/$REPO](https://github.com/$USER/$REPO/releases/tag/$PARENT_TAG)'
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"
fi
```

In the above example, the subrepository release links back to the parent release
which triggered it.
